# ðŸš‚ Alternative Railway Deployment - CLI Method

Since the web interface is having Railpack issues, let's use Railway CLI to force Docker deployment.

## Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

## Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
railway login
```

## Step 3: Initialize Project

```bash
railway init
```

## Step 4: Add MongoDB

```bash
railway add mongodb
```

## Step 5: Set Environment Variables

```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

## Step 6: Force Docker Deployment

```bash
railway up --detach
```

## Step 7: Get Your URL

```bash
railway domain
```

## Alternative: Manual Railway Configuration

If CLI doesn't work, try this in Railway web interface:

1. **Go to Railway Settings**
2. **Find "Build & Deploy" section**
3. **Set Build Command:** `docker build -t app .`
4. **Set Start Command:** `docker run -p $PORT:$PORT app`
5. **Save and redeploy**

## Expected Results:
- âœ… Docker build instead of Railpack
- âœ… Python application detected
- âœ… Backend running successfully
- âœ… Public URL generated
